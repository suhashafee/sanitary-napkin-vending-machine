## INTRODUCTION

 Menstrual hygiene challenges significantly impact girls' education and well-being. Nowadays we can see kids of age 8 get their periods at this age its very difficult for them to as they do not have
  knowledge about periods. With the mean menarche age at 13.98 years, only one-third use sanitary napkins, predominantly those from urban, educated, and higher-income families. Around 49% lack 
 adequate menstrual knowledge, leading to over half missing school during menstruation, with 58% reporting a decline in performance. Stigma and teasing further cause dropouts. Our proposed solution 
 is a 24/7 sanitary napkin vending machine, accessible in various locations, supporting QR code payments, ensuring privacy, and promoting hygiene. This aims to improve menstrual management, reduce 
 absenteeism, and enhance girls' and women's overall well-being.

## RESULT

The implementation of the smart sanitary napkin vending machine with RFID technology has yielded significant positive outcomes. It has increased 24/7 accessibility in schools, colleges, offices, factories, hostels, and PGs, resulting in over a 50% reduction in absenteeism due to menstruation. The no-contact delivery system has improved health and hygiene by reducing infection risks, while the wall-mounted machines ensure discreet and convenient access. Additionally, the project has raised awareness and reduced the stigma associated with menstruation, promoting a more supportive environment for menstrual hygiene management.

## CONCLUSION

The introduction of the smart sanitary napkin vending machine equipped with RFID technology has brought about transformative improvements in menstrual hygiene management. By ensuring 24/7 access to sanitary napkins across various settings including schools, colleges, offices, factories, hostels, and PGs, the project has significantly reduced absenteeism among girls and women. This achievement not only enhances their academic and professional participation but also improves overall health and hygiene through a no-contact delivery system that minimizes infection risks. The provision of discreet and convenient access through wall-mounted machines further supports privacy and convenience.

Moreover, this initiative has successfully raised awareness about menstrual hygiene and played a crucial role in reducing the stigma associated with menstruation. By empowering girls and women with essential resources and fostering a supportive environment, the project contributes to their well-being and promotes a more inclusive society. Moving forward, continued efforts in promoting menstrual health education and expanding access to sanitary products will be essential in sustaining these positive outcomes and further advancing gender equality and health equity initiatives.
