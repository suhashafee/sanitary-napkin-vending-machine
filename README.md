## INTRODUCTION

 Menstrual hygiene challenges significantly impact girls' education and well-being. Nowadays we can see kids of age 8 get their periods at this age its very difficult for them to as they do not have
  knowledge about periods. With the mean menarche age at 13.98 years, only one-third use sanitary napkins, predominantly those from urban, educated, and higher-income families. Around 49% lack 
 adequate menstrual knowledge, leading to over half missing school during menstruation, with 58% reporting a decline in performance. Stigma and teasing further cause dropouts. Our proposed solution 
 is a 24/7 sanitary napkin vending machine, accessible in various locations, supporting QR code payments, ensuring privacy, and promoting hygiene. This aims to improve menstrual management, reduce 
 absenteeism, and enhance girls' and women's overall well-being.
